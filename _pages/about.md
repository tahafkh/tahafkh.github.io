I’m Mohammad Taha Fakharian, an undergraduate computer engineering student living in Tehran, Iran. I first learned about programming in high school while I was getting familiar with algorithms. I developed a passion for software development as I began to write more code throughout my studies and personal projects. Since then, I have developed open-source projects which I encourage you to read more about on my GitHub page. Today, I work as an undergraduate research assistant at the University of Tehran, focusing on neuroscience and AI applications in other fields, e.g., AI in healthcare.

## What are my research interests?

My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and neuroscience, with a particular focus on understanding how the brain learns and encodes information. Additionally, I’m interested in finding out how our current knowledge of deep learning can help us answer open questions in neuroscience by making effective computational models. Finally, I am interested in the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in various domains, such as healthcare and finance. I'm a bit interested in new technologies like blockchain too.

## What are my other interests?

I have always been interested in football. I've been a huge fan of football since childhood. I like playing games and musical instruments too. I also enjoy reading books and watching movies in my free time.
