## Who am I?

Iâ€™m Mohammad Taha Fakharian, a computer engineering graduated B.Sc student living in Tehran, Iran. I first learned about programming in high school while I was getting familiar with algorithms. I developed a passion for software development as I began to write more code throughout my studies and personal projects. Since then, I have developed open-source projects which I encourage you to read more about on [my GitHub page](https://github.com/tahafkh). Today, I work as a research assistant, focusing on the intersection of AI and neuroscience(NeuroAI) and machine learning for neuroscience.

## What are my research interests?

My research focuses on the intersection of machine learning and neuroscience, particularly on understanding how the brain learns and encodes information. I believe the dialogue between neuroscience and AI (e.g. models and methods from deep learning) would allow us to gain a deeper understanding of the brain's computational function, which in turn can lead to the development of more powerful artificial intelligence models. Finally, I am interested in the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in various domains, such as healthcare and finance. I'm a bit interested in new technologies like blockchain too.

## What are my other interests?

I have always been interested in football. I've been a huge fan of football since childhood. I like playing games and musical instruments too. I also enjoy reading books and watching movies in my free time.
